/* 
  15: USE THE flex SHOTHAND PROPERTY
*/

/* 
  There is a shortcut available to set several flex propeties at once. 
  The flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties can all be set together by
  using the flex propperty.

  For example, flex: 1 0 10px; will set the item to flex-grow: 1;, flex-shrink: 0;,
  and flex-basis: 10px;

  The default property settings are: flex: 0 1 auto;
*/

/* 
  Add the CSS property flex to both #box-1 and #box-2. 
  Give #box-1 the values so its flex-grow is 2, its flex-shrink is 2, and its flex-basis is 150px.
  Give #box-2 the values so its flex-grow is 1, its flex-shrink is 1, and its flex-basis is 150px
