/* 
  03: USE THE flex-direction PROPERTY TO MAKE A ROW
*/

/* 
  Adding display: flex to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible 
  to align any children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the
  flex-direction property to the parent item and setting it to row or column.
  Creating a row will aign the children horizontally, and creating a column will align 
  the children vertically.

  Other options for flex-direction are row-reverse and column-reverse.

  Note: The default value for the flex-direction property is row.
*/

/* 
  Add the CSS property flex-direction to the #box-container element, and give it a
  value of row-reverse
*/

#box-container {
  height: 500px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}

#box-1,
#box-2 {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
}

#box-1 {
  background-color: dodgerblue;
}

#box-2 {
  background-color: orangered;
}
