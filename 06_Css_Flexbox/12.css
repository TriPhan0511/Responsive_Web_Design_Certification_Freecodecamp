/* 
  12: USE THE flex-shrink PROPERTY TO SHRINK ITEMS
*/

/* 
  So far, all the properties in the challenges apply to the flex container (the parent of the
  flex items). However, there are several useful PROPERTIES FOR THE FLEX ITEMS.

  The first is the flex-shrink property. When it's used, it allows an item to shrink if the
  flex container is too small. Items shrink when the width of the parent container is smaller
  than the combined widths of all the flex items within it.

  The flex-shrink takes numbers as value. The higher the number, the more it will shrink
  compared to the other items in the container. For example, if one item has a
  flex-shrink value of 1 and the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value
  of 3 will shrink three times as much as the other.

/* 
  Add the CSS property flex-shrink to both #box-1 and #box-2. Give #box-1 a value of 1 and
  #box-2 a value of 2.
