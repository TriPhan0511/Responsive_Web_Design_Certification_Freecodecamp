/* 
  09: ALIGN ELEMENTS USING THE align-items PROPERTY
*/

/* 
  The align-items property similar to justify-content. Recall that the justify-content property
  aligned flex items along the main axis. For rows, the main axis is horizontal line and
  for columns it is a vertical line.

  Flex containers also have a CROSS AXIS which is the opposite of the main axis.
  For rows, the cross axis is vertical and for columns, the cross axis is horizontal.
  
  CSS offers the align-items property to align flex items along the cross axis.
  For a row, it tells CSS how to push the items in the entire row up or down
  within the container.
  And for a column, how to push all the items left or right within the container.

  The different values available for align-items include:

    * flex-start: aligns items to the start of the container.
      For rows, this aligns items to the top of the container.
      For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.
      
    * flex-end: aligns items to the end of the container.
      For rows, this aligns items to the bottom of the container.
      For columns, this align items to the right of the container.

    * center: aligns items to the center.
      For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal space to the left and right of the items).

    * stretch: stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are
      stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom. This is the default value if no
      align-items value is specified.

    * baseline: align items to their baseline. Baseline is a text concept, think of it as
      the line that the letters sit on.
