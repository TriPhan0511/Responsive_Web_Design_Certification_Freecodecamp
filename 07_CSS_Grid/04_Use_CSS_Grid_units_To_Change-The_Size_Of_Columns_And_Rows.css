/* 
  04: USE CSS GRID units TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF COLUMNS AND ROWS
*/

/* 
  You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to define the size 
  of rows and columns. You can use these as well:

    * fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space.

    * auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically.

    * %: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.

  Here's the code that generates the output:
    
    grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;

  This snippet creates five coloumns.
  The first column is as wide as its content,
  the second column is 50px,
  the third column is 10% of its container,
  and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, 
  two are allocated for the fourth column, and one fir the fifth.

/* 
  Make a grid with three columns whose widths are as follows: 1fr, 100px, and 2fr
