/* 
  08: USE grid-column TO CONTROL SPACING
*/

/*
  Up to this point, all the properties that have been discussed are for grid containers.
  The grid-column property is the first one for use on the grid items themselves.

  The hypothetical horizontal and vertical lines that create the grid 
  are referred to as lines.
  These lines are numbered starting  with 1 at the top left corner of the grid and
  move right for columns and down for rows, couting upward. 

  To control the number of columns an item will comsume, you can use
  the grid-column property in conjunction with the line numbers you want the item
  to start and stop at.

  Here's an example:

    grid-column: 1 / 3;

  This will make the item start at the first vertical line of the grid on the left and
  span to the 3rd line of the grid, consume two columns.
 */

/* 
  Make the item with class item5 consume the last two columns of the grid.
